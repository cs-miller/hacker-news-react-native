# hacker-news-react-native

## Introduction

This is a React Native client for Hacker News, consuming the GraphQL API I wrote.
The purpose of this project is primarily to teach myself React Native and test out [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/).

You can try it out using [Expo](https://expo.io/@csmiller/hacker-news-react-native)
